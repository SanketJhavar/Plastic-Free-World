           <h2> 1) RAGI SPOONS:</h2>

<p>Imagine you are on a field trip. You find a wonderful place under a tree to have
lunch. The view is beautiful. There is a lake nearby and you can hear birds
chirping. You take out the paper dished and plastic spoons to eat the lunch.
After you are done eating the delicacies you brought with you. You wrap up
the paper dishes and spoon and put them in a plastic bag, and search for a
dustbin nearby. But you don’t find any nearby.
It might be one option to take the bag with you while you search for the
dustbin. Well, Narayana Peesapaty just solved this problem by creating EDIBLE
CUTLERY.</p> 
<p>
Yes, you read that right. The concept of edible cutlery isn’t exactly new to
Hyderabad. In fact edible spoons and plates have been in the city for some
time, first introduced as cutlery made with a ragi flour mix. To introduce
variety and cater to different types of food we eat , Narayana Peesapaty the
Founder of Bakeys edible cutlery has increased the range to include fork, soup
spoons and chopsticks as well. These come in sweet, sour and salted flavours.
Bakeys also has cutlery of spicy and non-spicy variety.</p>
<p>
Envisioned as an alternative to disposable cutlery, edible cutlery addresses
Narayana’s concern for the environment and depleting ground water levels in
the city. His millet-based cutlery is a good option for parties, outdoor catering,
picnics and to introduce children to the concern of plastic use, he says, adding,
“If one doesn’t want to eat them because they are quite dry, cows and goats
will polish them up. This way no one is wasting money or harming the
environment.”</p>
<p>
Speaking of other flavours he says, “I tried the same idea with the use of
chocolate flavour. But, that wasn’t a success because the flavour and use of
chocolate cannot bring down the moisture level to our requirement. Our
products are hard because we reduce the moisture level to the minimum; just
the amount required to keep things in place.” They are made to withstand
even hot liquid conditions for a considerable period. Unlike biscuits, they do
not drop off when dipped in liquids</p>
<p>
Narayana mostly uses jowar (sorghum) these days instead of ragi (finger
millets) because jowar allows different flavours to be mixed with it and unlike
ragi, it doesn’t have an overpowering taste. The cutlery also serves the</p>

<p>
purpose of promoting millets for consumption. As a result, “Farmers gets
encouraged to cultivate millets which require very less water” explains
Narayana.</p>
<p>
This cutlery is made to withstand even hot liquid conditions for a considerable
period. Unlike biscuits, they do not drop off when dipped in liquids. Bakeys’
manufacturing unit produces them in state of art machines with no use of
hands.</p>
<p>
Narayana’s success was appreciated by the National Geographic channel as
well.</p>
